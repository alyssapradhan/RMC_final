# WHO Malaria Report Dashboard
Welcome to my dashoboard, made for the final project of the GRAPH R Masterclass. The data for this project can be found from the WHO World malaria report 2023, available here: <https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/reports/world-malaria-report-2023>
Data was downloaded via the excel files available at this link

The initial component of my code is concerned with cleaning this dataset and joining with the rnaturalearth package in R in order to make chloropleth charts

The remainder of the file is the visualisation of the data with interactive plots using plotly. 

The dashboard can be found at <[https://alyssapradhan.github.io/Final_RMC/](https://alyssapradhan.github.io/RMC_final/)>
